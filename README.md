# Oddcast Offline Installers
A archive of majority of the voices used in the Oddcast TTS demo, all in their original installers to use on Windows' SAPI5 engine, This is useful if you want to use the voices elsewhere that isn't their TTS demo site, note that not every voice is on this site, As some voice installers I cannot find everywhere in the internet.

# Note
Most of the voices here come from different providers, The providers Oddcast uses for their API are:
- AT&T Natural (formerly)
- Loquendo 7 (formely Loquendo 6, upgraded to Loquendo 7 later on)
- NeoSpeech VoiceText
- Nuance Vocalizer for Automotive (formely ScanSoft Realspeak, upgraded to Nuance Vocalizer for Automotive later on)
